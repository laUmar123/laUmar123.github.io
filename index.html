                The year was 6 BC, the town of RPS had be ravaged with plagues and crime. With such an evil filled town,
                the knights had decided it would be time to destroy the town once and for all. News
                broke out to the people of RPS and they all gathered to choose a leader to defend this town. With no one
                willing to step forward, all hope was lost, but there emerged a man; face covered with a red cloth,
                wearing a shiny white dress.
                He offered to fight this knight, but made everyone vow to stop the crime in this land, and work with one
                another. With no other option, the people
                of RBS accepted his offer, and asked how he would defeat this unformidable knight. He put down a rock, a
                shield and two swords, and said "no more questions".

                but they all know they have no where to run, the knight takes the final steps in this future
                non-existant
                town.
